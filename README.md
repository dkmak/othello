# othello
/* This was project for ICS 32, "Programming with Software Libraries", taught by Alex Thorton in March of 2016.

The project was solely programmed in Python and made use of the TkInter library. It was prohibited to use code from any other sources, and  The assingment was done individually for each student. 

The assignemnt first required implementing the game logic of Othello into Python, and using that logic to play a console only version that used typed-out commands and . Once that was finished, the next part of the assignment was about implementing a GUI to play the game in a more user-friendly manner. 

The game logic of Othello was admittedly difficult, and took a long time for me to grasp. I throughly enjoyed making the GUI, and I really proud to see the game come to life.  This class was my first introductio to UI/UX design, and it was cool to build the game in the way that I imagined it in my head.

To play Othello, download all the files and run the p5_gui file. The start-up menu allows to determine the board size, who goes first, how the pieces are set up, and how the score is calcualted. Press 'OK', and start playing Othello! */
